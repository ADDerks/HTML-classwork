		<h1> A little information about DTCC student, Anthony "Tony" Derks. </h1>
		<p> I was born and raised in Minnesota, but joined the U.S. Marine Corps after High School in 2003.
			After my enlistment was up, I moved back to Minnesota and then to North Carolina, 
			where it is a lot warmer and for longer periods of time.</p>
		<p>	I am currently living in South Durham with my lovely wife of four years, 18 month old Daughter, 
			two dogs, a cat, and an aquarium of fish.</p>

		<p> When I am not working on school, or spending time with my family, I enjoy kayaking, and kayak fishing.
			I freqent B. Everett Jordan Lake, near the border of Durham and Chatham Counties to paddle, and relax.
			I have found, when I need assistance with rigging my kayak, or just looking for a way to fix little
			things with it, I find a lot of assistance from various online forums. A good one is this

			<a href="https://www.ncangler.com/forums/forums/56-Kayak-Fishing"> North Carolina fishing forums </a> which 
			has a lot of other categories in the fishing world, but this is the one that I keep to usually.

		<p> On the topic of fishing, when I can, I love to escape to the beaches of North Carolina and enjoy time surf fishing. </p>
		<p> Last Year, while fishing with my dad, I	caught this <strong> 4-foot Blacktip Shark </strong> that was only about <strong>
			30 feet away from the beach edge </strong>! That's why I don't swim all that often anymore. Although, this fish isn't considered "big" at all for the ocean, it was 
			absolutely amazing to feel the power that it had when I was holding it. Additionally, this was the biggest fish that I have caught to date, which is
			a pretty big thing for me.</p>
